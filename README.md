# IST-110-Portfolio
This will repository serves as a portfolio to contain assignments and various works gathered for my IST 110 class at Penn State.
Some files are too large to preview through GitHub and may require downloading to view.

Skills: JavaScript, Python, HTML, SQL Binary representation, operating systems, computer hardware, digital design, and group collaboration

Several assignments relied on knowledge I already had from computer science classes I have taken throughout college and high school or personal projects. These did not present many challenges. 
For assignments which I did not have a background knowledge on, I did not struggle as they were fairly simple to complete, but I learned a great deal about the subject, how it works, and why.
All assignments fall into one of the two categories just listed, so I had a very similar process for approaching each one. Below are sumamries of what I did and what I found interesting for each one.

Reflective Statements: 
- Binary Representation: I was able to review how to convert between binary and decimal as well as using ASCII which is crucial for understanding data
- Choose the Best OS: I was able to review the strenghts and weaknesses of various operating systems including Linux, Windows, MacOS which is helpful   
  for knowing when to use each specific one for a task
- CODIS: This taught me about how the FBI can use databasing to match records of convicts across decades and multiple cases which is a great, practical use of data collection
- Cybercrime: The research allowed me to understand the social impacts of cybercrime and how people perceive its importance compared to in-person crimes. Also who is likely to perform and be victim to it, and how punishments work
- Global Entrepreneurship: The events I attended allowed me to listen to industry professionals about the importance of the subjects we are learning in class and how they are important in the real world such as cybersecurity
- HTML: This assignmnet was a great review of how to use HTML to create a basic webpage
- iFixIt Teardown: This assignmnet was a great review of the various components of a computer, how they interact, and their significance
- In-class Exercise 10/15: This was a great review of how to find articles adn information on newsletters. It was helpful to see that Penn State provides us with New York Times subscriptions
- JavaScript: This assignmnet was a great review of how to use JS for higher level programming and dynamic webpages
- Cryptography Infographic: This assignmnet was a great review of how to use digital content creation tools like Adobe Suite to create an easy to follow visual to present information. I have used this is my ENGL 15 class so this was a nice refresher. I am currently taking a cryptography course, so this was able to reinforce concepts I learned from it
- What do Companies Know About You: This allowd me to discover how much information I reveal to the public and what critical information about my family can be found without me knowing. This made me aware of all the information about me that is easily accessible, so I was able to remove some of them.
- Learning Portfolio: As someone who has needed to make a portfolio for a while now, this assignment gave me the motivation to finally make it and showcase my projects. I will now use this more often to display my skills to hiring managers.
- Music Genome: The assignment helped reinforce material I learned in other classes about how algorithms and AI can detect patterns to provide recomendations. It was very interesting to see how it is used in a practical sense today
- OSINT: Like CODIS, this impressed me with how much previous records of data can be used in the future. OSINT surprised me as it is able to scrub billions of data points that are publically available and make decisions based from them. This is like the Music Genome assignment where tons of information can help in a practical way.
- Problem Solving Infographic: Like the Cryptography Infographic, this this assignment allowed me to review digital design and made me better at being able to research a topic and find valuable information about it.
- Python: This assignmnet was a great review of how to use Python and perform basic operations. Python is my strongest language, so this was a nice change of pace from my more difficult programs
- SQL: This assignmnet was a great review of how to use SQL to obtain information from a database. I have used SQL a lot in my previous internships, and while the command are fairly simple, it was nice to refresh my skills
